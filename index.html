                <p><code>Git</code>, a <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>,
                    is very flexible, smart, and intuitive. it is also an <strong>industry standard</strong> among
                    <code>developers</code> and

                <p><strong>Github</strong> provides hosting for <code>software
                        development</code> <strong>version control</strong> using <code>Git</code>. It is a
                    <em><strong>subsidiary</strong></em>
                    of <strong>Microsoft</strong>,
                    which
                    <em><strong>acquired</strong></em> <strong>Github</strong> in
                    2018 for $7.5 billion. It offers all of the <code>distributed version control</code> and
                    <code>source
                        code management</code>
                    functionality of <code>Git</code> as well as adding its own features. It is probably the most
                    <em><strong>accessibly social</strong></em>

                <p>
                    <code>Git</code> was <em><strong>created</strong></em> in 2005 by <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>
                    for the development
                    of the <code>Linux
                        kernel</code>.

                <p>
                    The <code>Linux kernel</code> is the main component of the <code>Linux</code> operating system
                    (<strong>OS</strong>)
                    and
                    the core interface between a computer's hardware and its processes. It
                    communicates between the two, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

                <p>
                    The <code>Linux kernel</code> is a large <strong>open source</strong>. During most of the time that
                    the
                    <code>Linux kernel</code> was maintained (1992-2002), <em><strong>changes</strong></em> to the
                    <strong>software</strong> were passed
                    around as <code>patches</code> and <code>archived files</code>. In 2002, the kernel project began
                    using
                    a <em><strong>proprietary</strong></em> <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong> (DVCS)
                    called <code>Bitkeeper</code>.

                <p>
                    In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the <code>Linux
                        kernel</code> and the commercial company that developed <code>Bitkeeper</code> broke down, and
                    the
                    tool's <em><strong>free of charge</strong></em> status was revoked. This got <strong>Linus
                        Torvalds</strong> to
                    create
                    his <strong>own tool</strong> based on what he learned from working with <code>BitKeeper</code>.

                <p>Since 2005, <code>Git</code> has evolved into an easy to use tool and
                    still retains these original qualities <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> sought to achieve. It is very

                <p>So what is <strong><em>centralized</em></strong> version control,
                    <em><strong>distributed</strong></em>
                    version control, and why use <code>distributed </code>version control such as <code>Git</code>

            <section class="section">
                <h2 class="capitalize">Centralized Version Control</h2>
                <p>A <em><strong>centralized</strong></em> version control system works on a
                    <code>client-server</code> model.</p>
                <p>There is a <em><strong>single</strong></em>, <em><strong>centralized</strong></em>, <strong>master
                        copy</strong> of
                    the <code>code
                        base</code>, and <em><strong>pieces</strong></em>
                    of the <code>code</code> that developers are working on are typically
                    <em><strong>locked</strong></em>, or <em><strong>checked out</strong></em>, so
                    that ONLY <strong>one
                        developer</strong> is
                    allowed to work on that part of the <code>code</code> at any one time.</p>

                    <em><strong>controlled</strong></em> by
                    the <strong>server</strong>. When the developer checks their code back in, the <code>lock
                        down</code> is
                    <em><strong>released</strong></em>,

                <h2 class="capitalize">Differences between <code>CVCS</code> and <code>DVCS</code></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no <em><strong>lockdown</strong></em> of <code>code</code> in a <code>DVCS</code>.</li>
                    <li>What does this mean? More than one developer, in fact any
                        number of
                        developers, can be working on the code at any given time.</li>
                    <li>Every <strong>set</strong> of <em><strong>new changes</strong></em> that a developer
                        <strong>makes</strong> to
                        the
                        <code>code</code> contains <em><strong>all</strong></em>
                        the <strong>history</strong> of the <code>code</code> at the point in
                        <em><strong>time</strong></em> he or she grabbed it
                        from the
                        <strong>remote repository</strong> and
                        the
                        <em><strong>new</strong></em> <code>history</code>
                        created from the <em><strong>new</strong></em> <code>changes</code> he or she makes
                        <code>locally</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>In other words, each developer has his/her own <code>copy</code>
                        of the <em><strong>complete
                                project</strong></em> in its <code>current state </code>at the time each developer grabs
                        a <code>copy</code> or
                        <em><strong>clones</strong></em> it <code>locally</code>,
                        meaning to their <strong>desktop</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>When they are done with their changes, they <strong>don't</strong>
                        have to <em><strong>wait</strong></em> for the
                        last person who checked out the code to check it back in as with <code>CVC</code>. They can
                        simply check it
                        back in, or rather,
                        <em><strong>push</strong></em> it to <code>remote</code> whenever they want. This has
                        <strong>certain
                            implications</strong>
                        which I will discuss a bit
                        later.</li>
                    <li>The <em><strong>performance</strong></em> of <code>DVCS</code> is better. There is no
                        <strong>waiting</strong> for <em><strong>lockdowns</strong></em> to
                        be <strong>unlocked</strong> across potentially <strong>slow networks</strong> or
                        <strong>networks</strong> which
                        <strong><em>aren't online</em></strong> at
                        all. In
                        addition, as mentioned
                        previously, the <code>complete code</code> as it's represented remotely at a given time, is on
                        each
                        developer's <code>local system</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>Branching</code> and <code>merging</code> of <em><strong>repositories</strong></em> is
                        much easier
                        to achieve in a <code>DVCS</code>
                        because they are built into the system itself. We will see practical application of that when we
                        set ourselves up
                        with <code>Git</code> and <strong>Github</strong> and <em><strong>push</strong></em> our project
                        from from our <code>local
                            computer</code> to <em><strong>remote</strong></em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>With a <code>DVCS</code>, you <em><strong>don't need</strong></em> to be
                        <strong>connected</strong> to a
                        <code>network</code> all the time.
                        Only when you want to view your changes via <code>localhost</code>. I'll explain that as well
                        via demonstration.</li>

                <p>With <code>CVCS</code>, you don't have to <em><strong>merge</strong></em> <code>different
                        versions</code> of
                    the <em><strong>same code</strong></em> unless you explicitly want to, so you avoid the
                    <em><strong>trickiness</strong></em>
                    of <strong>merging</strong> in <code>DVCS</code>.</p>

                    <em><strong>Lastly</strong></em>, I came across a <em><strong>great article</strong></em> on
                    <strong>Medium</strong>
                    that sums up why <code>Git</code> can
                    be great for
                    <em><strong>everyone</strong></em>. <em><strong>Not</strong></em>
                    just <strong>developers</strong>. It's entitled <a
